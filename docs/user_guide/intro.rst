User guide
==========

With the **HydroMT-FIAT plugin**, users can easily benefit from the rich set of tools of the

`Delft-FIAT <https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/DFIAT/Delft-FIAT+Home>`_ models from available global and local data.

This plugin assists the FIAT modeller in:

- Quickly setting up a Delft-FIAT model based on existing hazard maps, global exposure layers and a database of vulnerability curves.
- Making maximum use of the best available global or local data.
- Adjusting and updating components of a fiat model and their associated parameters in a consistent way.
