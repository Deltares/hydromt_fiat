Introduction
============

With the **hydromt_fiat plugin**, users can easily benefit from the rich set of tools of the 
`HydroMT package <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt>`_ to build and update 
`Delft-FIAT <https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT>`_ models from available global and local data.

This plugin assists the fiat modeller in:

- Quickly setting up a Delft-FIAT model based on existing hazard maps, global exposure layers and a database of vulnerability curves.
- Making maximum use of the best available global or local data.
- Adjusting and updating components of a FIAT model and their associated parameters in a consistent way.
