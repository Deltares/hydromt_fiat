HydroMT-FIAT: Automated and reproducible Delft-FIAT model building
=====================================================================

With the `HydroMT-FIAT plugin <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_fiat>`_, users can easily benefit 
from the rich set of tools of the `HydroMT package <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt>`_ to build and update 
`Delft-FIAT <https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT>`_ models from available global and local data.

This plugin assists the FIAT modeller in:

- Quickly setting up a Delft-FIAT model based on existing hazard maps, global and user-input exposure layers, and global, US national, or user-input vulnerability curves.
- Creating a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) based on US Census or user-input data.
- Adjusting and updating components of a Delft-FIAT model and their associated parameters in a consistent way.

The HydroMT-FIAT plugin aims to make the FIAT model building process **fast**, **modular**, and **reproducible** 
by configuring the model building process from single *yml* file.

For detailed information on HydroMT itself, you can visit the `core documentation <https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/>`_.
